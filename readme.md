<h1>Roland's Reddit Wallpapers App</h1>
<p>This app was made to learn JavaScript. It is modeled off an existing Wallpapers app made in React. Everything is redesigned in JavaScript from the ground up, though most of the functionality remains the same.</p>
<p>The original Wallpapers app can be found <a href="https://droidheat.com/r-wallpapers/">here for a live version</a> or <a href="https://github.com/gauravjot/react-reddit-wallpapers/">here for the GitHub</a>. </p>
